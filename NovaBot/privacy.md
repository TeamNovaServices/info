# NovaBot Privacy Policy
## A brief introduction of what we do with your data and how we handle it

In order for our service to function properly we store the following information about your Discord account and activity with our bot
- Your Discord ID in order to identify you across interactions
- The time you joined / first used our service
- The amount of times you have generated things with our service, these things include but are not limited to: audio, video, text, images
- The amount of credits you have in order to use the service
- A Secondary UserID not connected to your Discord Account
- A usage history of the bot created from your account
## When does my data get saved in the database?
- The moment you use your first command our system checks if you exist in our database, if not it will automatically add you.

## Is there a way I can get my data out of the database
- Yes! You can join our Community / Support Server and request a removal of your data by opening a ticket, note that removing your data will only wipe your **Discord ID**, Joined time, credits, and counters for generations. You will be re-added into our database once you use a new command, please make sure to [check the additional notes](#additional-notes)

## Are my generations being logged?
- No, we have specifically decided not to log any generations made with our service
- Note that we do not log the output or input of your generation, we do however log data about it like: who made it, how much it cost, a checksum of it, the time it was made and its type

## What happens when I buy a subscription or one-time-purchase on the NovaBot Service
- If you buy or subscribe to any service provided by the NovaBot you will instantly receive Access to it, if this is not the case we highly encourage you to open a ticket on our community Discord server to get things sorted out!

# Additional notes
- In case you request removal of your account while you have an active Entitlement (subscription) running, Discord will still provide us with your Entitlement IDs so you do not need to worry in case you want to re-enter the program, **however this does not count for one-time-purchases**, in case you buy a single use entitlement (additional credits etc.) they **will be lost**
- A data removal will not remove Bans or pentalties from your account as we keep a checksum of your Discord IDaudio, video, text, images
